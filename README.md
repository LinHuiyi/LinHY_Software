## **SIPI** (SNP Interaction Pattern Identifier) 
SIPI is a powerful tool for detecting SNP-SNP interactions associated with a binary or continuous outcome. For each SNP pair, **45 SNP-SNP interaction patterns** are tested.  


## **AA9int** (Additive-Additive 9 interaction pattern approach) 
AA9int, a mini-version of SIPI, evaluates **9 SNP interaction patterns**. For a large-scale study, the two stage approach of AA9int+SIPI is recommended for reducting computaiton time. **AA9int is a function in the SIPI R packate.**
